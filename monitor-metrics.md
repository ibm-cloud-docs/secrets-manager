# {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} operational metrics
{: #operational-metrics}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service to measure how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} records data on the operations that occur inside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. This service allows you to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. You can use its advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts based on API response codes, and design custom dashboards.

For more information regarding the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} service, check out [Getting started](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-getting-started){: external}.

Enabling {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service metrics adds new metrics to your {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance. For information on {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} pricing, check out [Pricing](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-pricing_plans){: external}.
{: tip}

## What metrics are available?
{: #metrics-available}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} to track the type of API requests being made in your service instance as well as the latency of the requests. The dashboard includes:

- Total requests being made in your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, categorized by API type.
- Failed API requests categorized by error type.
- API request latency over time, including the average latency, highest latency, and lowest latency.
- Total amount of secrets and secret groups in the instance.

## Before you begin
{: #operational-metrics-considerations}

### Configure a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance for metrics
{: #configure-monitor}

Other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} users with `administrator` or `editor` permissions can manage the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. These users must also have platform permissions to create resources within the context of the resource group where they plan to provision the instance.
{: important}

To enable platform metrics in a region, complete the following steps:

1. [Provision an instance of {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}}](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-provision){: external} in the region of the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance.

2. Go to the [Monitoring](/observe/monitoring) dashboard.

3. Click **Configure platform metrics.**

4. Select the region where the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance was created.

5. Select the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instance in which you would like to receive metrics.

6. Click **Configure.**

You can also reach this location by clicking on the **Actions** drop down menu in your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, followed by clicking on **Add monitoring**.

## {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} metrics details
{: #sm-metrics}

You can use the metrics in your monitoring instance dashboard to measure the types of requests being made in your service instance as well as the latency of the requests.

|`ibm_sm_write_private_requests_count`|Total amount of write requests in private network|Gauge|None|
|`ibm_sm_write_public_requests_count`|Total amount of write requests in public network|Gauge|None|
{: caption="Describes the API Hits metrics." caption-side="bottom"}

### Error count
{: #error-count}

This metric gathers the number of `4xx` and `5xx` errors encountered from all APIs.

|Metric Name|Description|Metric Type|Value Type|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`ibm_sm_4xx_errors_count`|Total amount of 4xx errors|Gauge|None|
|`ibm_sm_5xx_errors_count`|Total amount of 5xx errors|Gauge|None|
{: caption="Describes the API Hits metrics." caption-side="bottom"}

## Latency
{: #latency}

This metric tracks amount of time it takes {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} to receive an API request and respond to it.

The latency is calculated by getting the average of all requests of the same type that occur within 60 seconds.
{: note}
