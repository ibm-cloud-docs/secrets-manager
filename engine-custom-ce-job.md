# Creating a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job
{: #engine-custom-ce-job}

The custom credentials secret type allows {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} users to manage the lifecycle of credentials for external systems (for example, Artifactory, PagerDuty) using {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} APIs and integrations. To create custom credentials secrets, you must first set up an [ {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} project](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project#create-a-project) and [define a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-plan) to interface between {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} and the external service requiring credentials.
{: shortdesc}

Custom credentials support a wide range of third-party systems, so guidance for configuring your {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job is intentionally general, focusing on {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} best practices. If your parameters are correctly formatted and you select a valid {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} project and job, {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} can run the job with various configurations. However, {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} does not validate whether your configuration aligns with your specific use case. It only runs the provided setup.

To assist with implementing job logic for interacting with external providers, {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} offers developer documentation, best practices, job generator and deployer tools, and code examples. [Learn how to design](https://github.com/IBM/secrets-manager-custom-credentials-providers/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#designing-a-new-credentials-provider-job){: external} a new credentials provider job in the Custom Credentials Providers repository.

## Credentials provider job lifecycle
{: #credentials-provider-job-flow}

A typical job flow involves:

1. Creating the credentials, where new credentials are generated.
2. Deleting the credentials, where credentials are revoked.
3. Updating the secret task, which sends the result back to {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.

The following {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job flow diagram illustrates this lifecycle.

![The diagram shows the lifecycle of a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} credentials provider job.](/images/custom-credentials-ce-job-lifecycle-diagram.drawio.svg){: caption="{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job lifecycle" caption-side="bottom"}

{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} retries daily (for up to 10 days) to delete credentials after a failed deletion attempt. Request retries are recommended when applicable but omitted in the flow diagram for clarity. A `400` or `404` status response to the **Secret task update** request indicates that the secret task cannot be updated by a retry.

## Security considerations
{: #credentials-provider-security-considerations}

To enhance security:

* **Follow the principle of least privilege**: restrict job access to only the necessary secrets by using a dedicated secret group.
* **IAM roles**: assign the API key used by the job to authenticate with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} the **SecretTaskUpdater** role. If the job needs to read secrets, also assign the **SecretsReader** role. Both roles should be scoped to the dedicated secret group.
* **Avoid personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential data**: do not use personal identifiers or confidential data (such as email addresses or social security numbers) as input parameters or as credential IDs. {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} treats the input parameters and credential ID as metadata, not as sensitive secret data.

## Error handling
{: #credentials-provider-error-handling}

If the credentials provider job is unable to create or delete the credentials, it should update {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} with an application error code and a user facing error message. This error is displayed in the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} console for the failed task and allow the user to apply a corrective action.

## Troubleshooting
{: #credentials-provider-troubleshooting}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} configures {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} to immediately remove completed jobs. This prevents job run accumulation and helps avoid exceeding quota limits over time.
However, during development, you may want to retain completed jobs to review their configuration and logs.

To retain completed jobs using the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} UI:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Console, navigate to Containers → Projects, and open your credentials provider project.
2. Within the project page, go to Jobs, click the **Jobs tab**, and select your job.
3. In the Configuration page, open the Environment variables tab.
4. Locate the `CE_REMOVE_COMPLETED_JOBS` variable and click on its row to edit.
5. In the Edit environment variable panel, change the value from `IMMEDIATELY` to `3d`, then click Done.
6. Return to the Environment variables page and click **Deploy** (top right) to apply the changes. Completed job runs will now be retained for **3 days**.

For troubleshooting jobs in a production environment, it is recommended to integrate {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} with Cloud Logs. Refer to the documentation of both services for setup instructions.
