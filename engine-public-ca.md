# Connecting third-party certificate authorities
{: #add-certificate-authority}

With {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}}, you can connect to a third-party certificate authority by adding a configuration to your instance.
{: shortdesc}

A certificate authority (CA) is the entity that signs and issues your SSL/TLS certificates. By adding a CA configuration, you can specify the authority that you want to use when you [order public certificates](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-public-certificates#order-public-certificates) through {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.

You can define up to 10 certificate authority configurations per instance. To view a list of configurations that are available for your instance, go to the **Secrets engines > Public certificates** page in the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} UI.
{: note}
{: ui}

You can define up to 10 certificate authority configurations per instance. To obtain a list of configurations that are available for your instance, you can use the [List configurations](/apidocs/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-v2#get-configuration) API.
{: note}
{: api}

## Before you begin
{: #before-add-certificate-authority}

Before you get started, be sure that you have the required level of access. To manage engine configurations for your instance, you need the [**Manager** service role or higher](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam).

### Supported certificate authorities
{: #add-certificate-authority-supported}

You can integrate the following certificate authorities with your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instance.

| Prerequisites |
| :------------ |
| Before you connect Let's Encrypt, be sure that you:  \n  \n - Obtain the private key that's associated with your Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) account.  \n The ACME protocol makes it possible to automatically obtain browser trusted certificates without human intervention. Before you can request Let's Encrypt certificates through {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you must have an ACME account. If you already have a working ACME account, you need the private key that was generated when the account was initially created.  \n  \n - Optional: Create an ACME account.  \n If you don't have an existing ACME client or account, you can create one by using the [ACME account creation tool](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-security/acme-account-creation-tool){: external}. |

{: #add-certificate-authority-prereqs}
{: tab-title="Let's Encrypt"}
{: tab-group="ca-prereqs"}
{: class="simple-tab-table"}

Certificate authorities might apply a charge when you order or renew a certificate. Additionally, various rate limits apply. {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} does not control costs or rate limits that are associated with ordering certificates. For more information about rate limits to keep in mind as you order Let's Encrypt certificates, check out the [Let's Encrypt documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/){: external}.
{: note} 

## Adding a certificate authority configuration in the UI
{: #add-certificate-authority-ui}
{: ui}

You can add certificate authority configurations to your service instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} UI.

1. In the console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Resource List**.
2. From the list of services, select your instance of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.
3. In the **Secrets engines** page, click the **Public certificates** tab.
4. In the Certificate authorities table, click **Add**.
5. Select the certificate authority that you want to use. Currently, Let's Encrypt is supported.
   1. To target the production environment, select **Let's Encrypt**.
   2. To target the staging environment, select **Let's Encrypt (Staging)**. Choose this option if you'd like to issue certificates that aren't production-ready yet.
6. Add the private key file in PEM format that's associated with your [ACME account](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-prepare-order-certificates#create-acme-account) or enter its value.
7. Click **Add**.

   You can now select this configuration when you order a certificate. To modify or remove an existing configuration, click **Actions** menu ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg) in the row of the configuration that you want to update.


## Adding a certificate authority configuration from the CLI
{: #add-certificate-authority-cli}
{: cli}

You can add certificate authority configurations to your service instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} CLI.

To add a configuration, run the [**`ibmcloud secrets-manager configuration-create`**](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secrets-manager-cli#secrets-manager-cli-configuration-create-command) command.

```sh
ibmcloud secrets-manager configuration-create '{
  config_type": "public_cert_configuration_ca_lets_encrypt",
  "lets_encrypt_environment": "production", 
  "lets_encrypt_private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMY_PRIVATE_KEY_WITH_NEWLINES_TRANSFORMED_TO_\N_CHARS-----...", "name": "my-lets-encrypt-config"
  }'
```
{: pre}


## Adding a certificate authority configuration with the API
{: #add-certificate-authority-api}
{: api}

You can add certificate authority configurations to your service instance by calling the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} API. 

The following example shows a query that you can use to add a configuration for Let's Encrypt. When you call the API, replace the `private_key` value with the private key that is associated with your [ACME account](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-prepare-order-certificates#create-acme-account).
{: curl}

Be sure to convert your private key file to single-line format so that it can be parsed correctly by the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} API. You can use the following UNIX command to format the file to a single-line string: `awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' <private_key_file>`
{: tip}


```sh
curl -X POST 
  --H "Authorization: Bearer {iam_token}" \
  --H "Accept: application/json" \
  --H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --d '{
    "config_type": "public_cert_configuration_ca_lets_encrypt",
    "lets_encrypt_environment": "production",
    "lets_encrypt_private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEowIBAAKCAQEAqcRbzV1wp0nVrPtEpMtnWMO6Js1q3rhREZluKZfu0Q8SY4H3",
    "name": "lets-encrypt-config"
  }' \
    "https://{instance_ID}.{region}.secrets-manager.appdomain.cloud/api/v2/configurations"

```
{: codeblock}
{: curl}


A successful response adds the configuration to your service instance. For more information about the required and optional request parameters, see [Add a configuration](/apidocs/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-v2#create-configuration){: external}.
