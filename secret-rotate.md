# Manually rotating secrets
{: #manual-rotation}

With {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}}, you can manually create new versions of a secret.
{: shortdesc}

When you rotate a secret in your service instance, you create a new version of its value. Rotating your credentials limits how long a protected resource can be accessed by a single secret, which can protect your business against the risks that are associated with compromised credentials. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 30 or 60 days, so that you're always meeting best practices around secrets management.


## Before you begin
{: #before-manual-rotate}

Before you get started, be sure that you have the required level of access. To rotate secrets, you need the [**Writer** service role or higher](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam).

### Supported secret types
{: #manual-rotate-by-type}

All the secrets that you store in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} can be rotated and replaced on-demand. How {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} evaluates a request to rotate a secret depends on the secret type.

| Type | Rotation description |
| --- | --- |
| [Arbitrary secrets](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets) | Arbitrary secrets are immediately replaced with the data that you provide on rotation. |
| [IAM credentials](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials) |IAM credentials, which consist of a service ID and API key, are immediately regenerated according to their initial configuration. If the IAM credentials secret was created by using an existing service ID in the account, only the API key is regenerated as part of a manual rotation. In contrast, if the secret was created by selecting an access group, both the service ID and API key values are regenerated when they're manually rotated. Important: the **Reuse IAM credentials until lease expires** (`reuse_api_key`) option for an IAM credentials secret impacts whether it can be rotated manually. If this field is `false` or set to **Off** in the UI, manual rotation isn't supported. The API key that is dynamically generated for the secret on each read is already a single-use, ephemeral value.|
| [Imported certificates](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-certificates#import-certificates) | Certificates that were initially imported to a service instance are immediately replaced with the data that you reimport on rotation. |
| [Key-value secrets](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-key-value) | Key-value secrets are immediately replaced with the data that you provide on rotation. |
| [Private certificates](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-private-certificates#create-private-certificates) | Private certificates are immediately replaced with a certificate that is signed by its parent or issuing certificate authority.|
| [Public certificates](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-public-certificates#order-public-certificates) | Public certificates move to the **Active, Rotation pending** status to indicate that a request to rotate a certificate is being processed. {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} sends the request to the configured certificate authority (CA), for example Let's Encrypt, to validate the ownership of your domains. If the validation completes successfully, a new certificate is issued. |
| [User credentials](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-user-credentials) | Passwords that are associated with user credentials secrets are immediately replaced with the data that you provide on rotation. |
| [Service credentials](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-service-credentials) | The Service credentials secret is replaced with a new one. The previous secretremains available for the remaining time in the defined TTL. |
| [Custom credentials](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-custom-credentials) | The Custom credentials secret is replaced with a new one. The previous secret remains available for the remaining time in the defined TTL. |

{: caption="Describes how {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} evaluates manual rotation by secret type" caption-side="top"}

Note that in the case of service credentials created for Databases, if in addition to the credential you are also altering the database permissions for the created credential, these will not be synced once the service credential was rotated. When rotating a Databases service credential, this is considered an identity rotation.

### Creating new versions of public certificates with your own DNS provider in the UI
{: #rotate-certificates-manual-ui}
{: ui}

To rotate a public certificate that was created by using a manual DNS provider in the UI, complete the following steps.

1. In the console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Resource List**.
2. From the list of services, select your instance of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.
3. In the row for the certificate that you want to rotate, click the **Actions** menu ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg) **> Rotate**.
4. Optional: Add a name and description to easily identify your certificate.
5. Optional: Click **Update**.
6. Click **Challenges** to access the TXT record name and value that are associated with each of your domains. You need them to complete the challenges.
7. To validate the ownership of your domains, manually add the TXT records that are provided for each of your domains to your DNS provider account. You must address only the challenges that are not validated, before the expiration date. 

    If you order a certificate for subdomains, for example, `sub1.sub2.domain.com`, you need to add the TXT records to your registered domain `domain.com`.
    {: note}

8. Verify that the TXT records that you added to your domains are propagated. Depending on your DNS provider, it can take some time to complete.
9. After you confirm that the records are propagated, click **Validate** to request Let's Encrypt to validate the challenges to your domains and create a public certificate. 

   If the order fails, for example, if the TXT records were not successfully propagated, you must start a new order to proceed. 
   {: note}

10. When your certificate is issued, clean up and remove the TXT records from the domains in your DNS provider account.

## Manually creating new versions of secrets from the CLI
{: #manual-rotate-cli}
{: cli}

You can manually rotate your secrets and certificates by using the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} CLI plug-in.

### Rotating arbitrary secrets
{: #manual-rotate-arbitrary-cli}
{: cli}

To rotate an arbitrary secret by using the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} CLI plug-in, run the [**`ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-version-create`**](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secrets-manager-cli#secrets-manager-cli-secret-version-create-command) command. For example, the following command rotates a secret and assigns `new-secret-data` as its new version.


```sh
ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-version-create \    
   --secret-id=SECRET_ID \    
   --secret-version-prototype='{"payload": "updated secret credentials", "custom_metadata": {"anyKey": "anyValue"}, "version_custom_metadata": {"anyKey": "anyValue"}}'
