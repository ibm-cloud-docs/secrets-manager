# Managing IAM access for {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}
{: #iam}

Access to {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}} service instances for users in your account is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). Every user that accesses the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM role. The policy determines which actions a user can perform within the context of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.
{: shortdesc} 

IAM access policies enable access to be granted at different levels. Some of the options include the following actions: 

- Access across all {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instances in your account
- Access to an individual {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance in your account
- Access to a specific resource within a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, applicable type is `secret-group`

## IAM roles and actions for {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} 
{: #iam-roles-actions}

Review the following [platform and service roles](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles#platformroles) that you can use to assign access to {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instances. Each role maps to specific {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} actions that a user can complete within an account or an individual instance.

If a specific role and its actions don't fit the use case that you're looking to address, you can [create a custom role](/docs/account?topic=account-custom-roles&interface=ui#custom-access-roles) and pick the actions to include.
