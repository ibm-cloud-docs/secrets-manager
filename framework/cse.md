# Using service endpoints to privately connect to {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}
{: #service-connection}

To ensure that you have enhanced control and security over your data when you use {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you have the option of using private routes to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service endpoints. Private routes are not accessible or reachable over the internet. By using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private service endpoints feature, you can protect your data from threats from the public network and logically extend your private network.
{: shortdesc}


## Before you begin
{: #prereq-service-endpoint}

You must first enable virtual routing and forwarding in your account, and then you can enable the use of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private service endpoints. For more information about setting up your account to support the private connectivity option, see [Enabling VRF and service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint).

Keep in mind the following considerations:

- You can select a service endpoint option for a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance only at its creation.

## Setting up private endpoints for {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} in the UI
{: #endpoint-setup-ui}
{: ui}

After your account is enabled for VRF and service endpoints, you can provision a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instance to connect over a private service endpoint.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to the [{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} offering details page](/catalog/services/secrets-manager){: external}.
2. In the **Create** tab, select the region where you want provision your instance.
3. Review and select a pricing plan.
4. Provide a name for your instance.
5. Select a resource group.
6. Determine an option for managing encryption for your instance.

    You can enhance the security of your secrets at rest by integrating with a key management service. For more information about customer-managed encryption, check out [Protecting your sensitive data in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-mng-data#data-encryption).
7. From the list of endpoint options, select **Public and private** or **Private only**.

    By default, {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instances accept API requests from both public and private endpoints. To limit access to your instance to take place only through a private network, select the **Private only** option.
8. Click **Create**.

    Provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance can take 5 - 15 minutes to complete.
    {: note}

## Setting up private endpoints for {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} from the CLI
{: #endpoint-setup-cli}
{: cli}

After your account is enabled for VRF and service endpoints, you can provision a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instance to connect over a private service endpoint.

1. In a terminal window, log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}

    If the login fails, run the `ibmcloud login --sso` command to try again. The `--sso` parameter is required when you log in with a federated ID. If this option is used, go to the link listed in the CLI output to generate a one-time passcode.
    {: note}

2. Select the account, region, and resource group where you want to create a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instance.

    You can use the following command to set your target region and resource group.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -r <region_name> -g <resource_group_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. (Optional) Check whether your account is enabled for VRF and service endpoints.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud account show
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following CLI output shows the account details of a VRF and service
    endpoint-enabled account.

    ```plaintext
    Retrieving account John Doe's Account of john.doe@email.com...
    OK

    Account ID:                   d154dfbd0bc2edefthyufffc9b5ca318
    Currently Targeted Account:   true
    Linked Softlayer Account:     1008967
    VRF Enabled:                  true
    Service Endpoint Enabled:     true
    ```
    {: screen}

    For more information about enabling VRF and service endpoints in your account, see
    [Enabling VRF and service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint).
    {: tip}

4. Create a private {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service instance by running the following command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance-create <instance_name> secrets-manager trial <region> -p '{"allowed_network": "<connectivity-option>"}'
    ```
    {: pre}

    | Variable | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | `region` | The region abbreviation, such as `us-south` that represents the geographic area where you want your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} to be handled and processed. For a complete list of supported regions, see [Regions and endpoints](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-endpoints). |
    | `connectivity-option` | The network connectivity option that you want to allow for your instance.  \n  \n To allow access to the instance over both public and private service endpoints, use `public-and-private`. To limit API requests to the instance to take place only through a private network, use `private-only`. Keep in mind that the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service UI is not accessible for `private-only` instances. |
    {: caption="Variable descriptions" caption-side="top"}


5. (Optional) Verify that that the service instance was created successfully.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance <instance_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance can take 5 - 15 minutes to complete.
    {: note}


## Viewing your endpoint URLs
{: #endpoint-view}

The service endpoint URLs are different for private and public network connections. You can find your service endpoint URLs in the **Endpoints** page of the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} UI. For more information about retrieving your service endpoint URLs programmatically, see [Regions and endpoints](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-endpoints#view-endpoint-urls).
