# Deleting secrets
{: #delete-secrets}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}} to delete a secret and its contents.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-delete-secrets}

Before you begin, be sure that you have the required level of access. To delete secrets, you need the [**Manager** service role](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam).

If you have a service ID or API key that was generated by the IAM credentials secret engine and delete your instance of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you must also delete the secret from IAM.
{: tip}

## Deleting secrets in the UI
{: #delete-secret-ui}
{: ui}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} UI to manually delete your secrets.

1. In the console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Resource List**.
2. From the list of services, select your instance of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.
3. Use the **Secrets** table to browse the secrets in your instance.
4. In the row for the secret that you want to delete, click the **Actions** menu ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg) **> Delete**.
5. Enter the name of the secret to confirm its deletion.
6. Click **Delete**.

If attempting to delete a custom credentials secret, note that it cannot be deleted if it has a secret version that still needs to be deleted in the credentials provider.  
You can force delete it by ticking the force delete checkbox.
{: note}

## Deleting secrets from the CLI
{: #delete-secret-cli}
{: cli}

To delete a secret, run the [**`ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-delete`**](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secrets-manager-cli#secrets-manager-cli-secret-delete-command) command.

If attempting to delete a custom credentials secret, note that it cannot be deleted if it has a secret version that still needs to be deleted in the credentials provider.  
You can force delete it using the `--force-delete` option.
{: note}


```sh
ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-delete --id ID
```
{: pre}

For more information about the command options, see [**`ibmcloud secrets-manager secret`**](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secrets-manager-cli#secrets-manager-cli-secret-command).

## Deleting secrets with the API
