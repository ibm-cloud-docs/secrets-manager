# Known issues and limits
{: #known-issues-and-limits}

{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}} includes the following known issues and limits that might impact your experience.
{: shortdesc}

## Known issues
{: #issues-and-limitations}

Review the following known issues that you might encounter as you use {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple secrets of the same type can't be created with the same name. | It is not possible to create more than one secret of the same type with the same name. This limitation applies at the instance level. To organize similar secrets of the same type across multiple secret groups in your instance, try adding a prefix or suffix to the names of those secrets. |
| Secrets can't be transferred between secret groups. | If you accidentally assign a secret to the wrong secret group, or if you don't want a secret to belong to the default secret group, you must delete the secret and create a new one. |
| API keys that are associated with an IAM secret aren't valid immediately after they are generated. | If you have automation in place that calls the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} API to get the API key for an IAM secret, add a wait delay of 2 seconds to allow the new API key to be recognized by IAM. |
| IAM credentials with a time-to-live (TTL) don't immediately expire. | After a secret with a TTL reaches the end of its lease duration, expect a tolerance of 1 - 2 minutes before the secret's associated service ID is deleted by IAM. |
| Users that have **Writer** or **Manager** service access that is scoped to secret groups are unable to create some types of secrets when they use the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} UI. | If you have **Viewer** platform access and **Writer** or **Manager** service access that is scoped to a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service secret group, it might not be possible to create secrets in the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} dashboard that require an engine configuration, for example, IAM credentials, public certificates, or private certificates. As a workaround, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} CLI plug-in, APIs, or SDKs to manage those secret types. |
| Community plug-ins for Vault are not supported. | It is not possible to integrate a community plug-in for Vault with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, unless it is written against a secrets engine that {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} supports. |
| When you delete an instance of the service, your API keys are not deleted from IAM. | If you have a service ID or API key that was generated by the IAM credentials secret engine and delete your instance of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you must also delete the secret from IAM. |
| IAM Custom Roles are not supported when using Vault API. | Using IAM Custom Roles is fully supported when using the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service API. |

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| There is a global one-to-one mapping of custom credentials configurations to a credentials provider {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job. | Replicate your credentials provider job. |
| A custom credentials configuration cannot be updated to reference a different credentials provider {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job. | Create a new custom credentials configuration. |
| A custom credentials configuration cannot be updated to change or remove a referenced IAM Credentials secret. | Create a new custom credentials configuration. |
| A custom credentials configuration schema (parameters and credentials) is mapped to the credentials provider {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job environment variables at {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} configuration creation time. | Create a new custom credentials configuration to accommodate updates to a credentials providerâ€™s environment variables. |
| {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} configures {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} jobs to immediately remove completed job runs to avoid {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} rate limits. | You can change the value of the job variable CE_REMOVE_COMPLETED_JOBS to a value such as â€˜3dâ€™ in the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} UI to review completed job runs and their logs during development time. |
| A {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance can be configured with up to 10 custom credentials configurations. | Create a new {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance. |
| A custom credentials secret maintains a history of 100 tasks. | Refer to {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} in {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to review task history. |
|{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} will apply daily retries for failed â€˜delete credentialsâ€™ tasks for up to 10 days. | Monitor Event Notifications and logs for failed task events and periodically check your external credentials provider for stale or expired credentials. |
| {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}â€™s secret tasks are throttled to avoid overloading {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}. Slowness may be experienced during operations that change custom credentials secret states when dealing with a large queue. | Design your workloads that consume custom credentials to expect possible delays until secrets are rotated. 
| Secret lock mode remove_previous_and_delete is not supported. | Use lock mode remove_previous and call the delete secret version data api, specifying secret version id=previous. |
| Avoid using personal identifiers (for example, email addresses, social security numbers) or confidential data as input parameters and as credential IDs. {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} treats the input parameters and credential ID as metadata, not as sensitive secret data. | Use parameter type secret_id to pass a reference to a secret managed in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} containing the confidential data. Then in the credentials provider job retrieve the secret to access its confidential data. 
| Updates made to a secret ttl and parameters fields are applied to a new version of the secret. | Rotate the secret to create a new version to apply the changes. |
| Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance will not bulk delete the managed third-party credentials. | When planning to permanently delete a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance first delete all its secrets. |
