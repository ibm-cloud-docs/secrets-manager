# Known issues and limits
{: #known-issues-and-limits}

{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}} includes the following known issues and limits that might impact your experience.
{: shortdesc}

## Known issues
{: #issues-and-limitations}

Review the following known issues that you might encounter as you use {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple secrets of the same type can't be created with the same name. | It is not possible to create more than one secret of the same type with the same name. This limitation applies at the instance level. To organize similar secrets of the same type across multiple secret groups in your instance, try adding a prefix or suffix to the names of those secrets. |
| Secrets can't be transferred between secret groups. | If you accidentally assign a secret to the wrong secret group, or if you don't want a secret to belong to the default secret group, you must delete the secret and create a new one. |
| API keys that are associated with an IAM secret aren't valid immediately after they are generated. | If you have automation in place that calls the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} API to get the API key for an IAM secret, add a wait delay of 2 seconds to allow the new API key to be recognized by IAM. |
| IAM credentials with a time-to-live (TTL) don't immediately expire. | After a secret with a TTL reaches the end of its lease duration, expect a tolerance of 1 - 2 minutes before the secret's associated service ID is deleted by IAM. |
| Certificates that you order from Let's Encrypt can't have a Common Name (CN) that exceeds 64 characters in length. | As a workaround, during the certificate order process, you can configure a shorter domain name so that it can be used as the certificate CN in your DNS provider. Then, you can order a multi-domain SAN certificate that uses the same shortened domain as the CN, along with longer application domains that are specified as Subject Alternative Names (SANs). |
| Users that have **Writer** or **Manager** service access that is scoped to secret groups are unable to create some types of secrets when they use the Secrets Manager UI. | If you have **Viewer** platform access and **Writer** or **Manager** service access that is scoped to a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service secret group, it might not be possible to create secrets in the Secrets Manager dashboard that require an engine configuration, for example, IAM credentials, public certificates, or private certificates. As a workaround, you can use the Secrets Manager CLI, APIs, or SDKs to manage those secret types. |
| Community plug-ins for Vault are not supported. | It is not possible to integrate a community plug-in for Vault with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, unless it is written against a secrets engine that {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} supports. To manage {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} secrets by using the full Vault native experience, use the [stand-alone {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} plug-ins for Vault](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs#faq-vault-community-plugins). |
| When you delete an instance of the service, your API keys are not deleted from IAM. | If you have a service ID or API key that was generated by the IAM credentials secret engine and delete your instance of {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you must also delete the secret from IAM. |
